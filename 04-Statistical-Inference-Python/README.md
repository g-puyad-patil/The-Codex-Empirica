# 📉 Module IV: Statistical Inference (Python)

## 🧪 Project: World Bank Science & Technology Analysis
**Objective:** To apply rigorous statistical methodologies to World Bank global data, identifying hidden correlations and validating year-over-year shifts in technological development through hypothesis testing.

### 🏛️ Engineering & Analytical Challenges
* **Data Synthesis:** Consolidating raw World Bank datasets into a clean, analysis-ready structure.
* **Outlier Detection:** Utilizing morphological visualizations (Boxplots) to identify and isolate data anomalies that could skew statistical significance.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Implementing T-Tests to determine if observed differences between yearly datasets are statistically significant or merely the result of variance.

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Descriptive Analytics:** Extracting core metrics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of global technology indicators.
* **Relational Correlation:** Constructing correlation matrices and scatter plots to quantify the strength of relationships between disparate data variables.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Executing T-tests (Independent/Paired) to validate the "Null Hypothesis" regarding development trends across different timeframes.

### 📊 Empirical Insights
* **Year-over-Year Growth:** Validated whether the increase in science and technology metrics was statistically significant.
* **Relationship Mapping:** Uncovered the strength of the linear relationship between specific World Bank economic indicators.
* **Integrity Validation:** Ensured that all findings were derived from "Clean Room" data, free from null-value bias.
